# What it does #

This application is to be tied together with a web form. It will accept the submission of a web form and turn the labels and the associated input fields and convert the data into JSON formatted records in a database. Then when you log access the web application it will display any 'locker' (web form) that you have access to or own. If you click on the 'locker' name it will direct you to all of the submissions for that specific 'locker'. If you want to see all of the data for a specific submission you can scroll through the records and find the exact submission and click on the timestamp. If you click that it will direct you to another page that has all the information from the web form in the same order as the form. It is a nice formatted way to recall the form submission. The application only allows you to see 'lockers' that you have ownership of or 'lockers' that are shared with you by another user in the system. Only the owner of the 'locker' has the ability to add or delete shares on a 'locker'.
